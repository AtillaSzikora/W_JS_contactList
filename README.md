# W_JS_contactList

Create a web based contact list which can show multiple contacts' info in one page. Every contact has the following properties:

	FirstName
	LastName
	City
	Address
	Email
	Phone
	
Every contact item should appear in a business card format.
To generate random test data use the public API described below.
Create a new object in your javascript file named Contact which can store all the data of a particular contact so you can parse the JSON data into this.
Use XMLHttpRequest to get the data from the API.
Push all your code into a new GitHub repository.
Submit your repository link here.
